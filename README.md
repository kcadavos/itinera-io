### Project Summary
Traveling with friends should be all about adventure, not endless group chats and decision fatigue. That’s where Itinera.IO comes in—the ultimate travel planner that makes group trips effortless and fun. Everyone in your crew can suggest activities, vote on what sounds epic, and Itinera auto-builds the perfect itinerary based on what the group actually wants to do. No stress, no over-planning—just pure stress-free adventure. Whether you’re backpacking through Europe, hitting up music festivals, or road-tripping to the unknown, Itinera makes sure the whole squad is on the same page. Less planning, more exploring. Let’s go!”

        Location
        Details (Optional)
    Voting System – Travelers vote on suggested activities.
    Itinerary Generation – The app automatically generates itineraries based on the most popular choices.
